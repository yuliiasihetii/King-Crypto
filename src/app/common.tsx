    title: "What does AML crypto address check reveal?",
    text: "The cryptocurrency AML check provides a clear indication, expressed as a percentage, of the likelihood that the given crypto address is associated with bitcoin money laundering. This percentage is calculated based on the types of services the address has interacted with and the portion of funds processed through these services. In simple terms, it helps assess the risk of unlawful activity connected to the specified address.",
  },
  {
    title: "What values do the AML screening results contain?",
    text: `KingCrypto AML KYC analyzes the provided crypto wallet address
    for connections with known services in the blockchain. These services are categorized based on
    the level of risk associated with illegal activities incl. laundering money with bitcoin and
    other crypto currencies. The verification results display the percentage of connections between
    the verified crypto address and each risk group. Using this information, the average risk level
    is calculated. This comprehensive evaluation assists users in making informed decisions
    regarding their assets and transactions.
`,
  },
  {
    title: "How to interpret the risk assessment?",
    text: `Each customer determines the level of risk they are willing to
    take on. We suggest categorizing risk values as follows: 0-25% — Low risk, indicating a clean
    wallet or a secure transaction; 25-75% — Medium risk, generally acceptable for most users; 75%
    and above — High risk, indicating potentially hazardous wallets or transactions. Additionally,
    it is recommended to pay attention to the red risk sources detailed on the detailed analysis
    page. These details provide extra information for making informed decisions regarding the
    security of your finances and anti money laundering bitcoin protection.
`,
  },
  {
    title: "How fast does the balance replenishment occur?",
    text: `The time required to replenish your balance depends on the
    payment timing after the invoice issuance. If the payment is made within 24 hours of invoice
    issuance, the balance is replenished within 10 minutes. If the payment is received more than 24
    hours after the invoice issuance, the replenishment takes up to 25 minutes. Generally,
    transactions in BTC, ETH, USDT, and fiat currencies are processed faster compared to other
    cryptocurrencies.
`,
  },
  {
    title: "How to interpret the risk assessment in percentage?",
    text: `The risk assessment presented in percentage reflects the connections of
    the verified address with various users in the blockchain, each having their individual risk
    level. KingCrypto analyzes transactions and associations with users, assigning a conditional risk
    to each of them. The overall risk assessment is calculated as the average of the risks
    associated with each of the identified sources. For example, if out of 2 BTC in the verified
    wallet, 1 BTC was received from mining (0% risk) and the other 1 BTC came from the Darknet (100%
    risk), the overall risk assessment would be 50%. This information allows evaluating the overall
    risk level associated with the given address, aiding users in making informed decisions
    regarding their financial transactions.

  {
    title: "How does KingCrypto AML help avoid crypto wallet blocks?",
    text: `KingCrypto AML KYC assists in avoiding blocks by allowing wallet
    AML verification of counterparts before engaging in transactions. If the risk assessment for a
    specific counterpart is high, you can decide to refrain from the transaction, thus preventing
    potential issues in the future. Additionally, before transferring funds to other services, you
    can verify your wallet address and save the AML KYC verification result, for instance, by taking
    a screenshot. If the AML procedure confirms that your assets have no connection to illegal
    activities, yet you still face a block from the service, you can provide the saved verification
    result as evidence of your asset's cleanliness. This method ensures the legality of your
    financial activities and prevents arbitrary blocks from services.

    title:
      "What to do if the risk assessment is above 50%, but I am confident the crypto address is safe?",
    text: `The risk evaluation offered by KingCrypto AML KYC relies on
    regularly updated international databases. Consequently, an address that showed low risk
    yesterday might be linked to a risky counterpart today due to data updates. In such instances,
    the AML risk assessment can fluctuate. If you are confident in the bitcoin address's safety and
    wish to validate it, we can conduct a more comprehensive KYC AML verification for you.

    title:
      "How do address verification and transaction analysis through TxID differ?",
    text: `Address verification (wallet) entails a comprehensive analysis
    of all addresses linked to a specific wallet, encompassing both the sources from which funds
    were received and the destinations to which funds were sent. This method delves into the
    complete transaction history, examining the intricate connections between various addresses
    within the blockchain network. On the other hand, transaction analysis via TxID necessitates the
    input of a specific transaction identifier (TxID). This analysis offers two distinct
    perspectives: Funds Received (Recipient) and Deposit Address: This option explores the
    relationships among addresses from which the funds originated, including the addresses
    associated with these funds before the specified transaction. Funds Sent (Sender) and Withdrawal
    Address: Here, the focus is on the wallet that received the funds, investigating all its
    connections leading up to the transaction. When conducting TxID analysis, risks are evaluated
    for both the recipient (in the «Recipient» scenario) and the sender (in the «Sender» scenario).
    This approach enables a meticulous examination of connections and transactions within the
    blockchain, providing a detailed perspective on a specific transaction's complexities.

    unfamiliar wallet or smart contract. This practice is especially vital for substantial or
    unconventional transactions, as well as when suspicions arise concerning unlawful activities or
    fraudulent behavior. Regular checks ensure you stay updated on prevailing risks, empowering you
    to make well-informed decisions regarding your financial transactions. Stay abreast of the
